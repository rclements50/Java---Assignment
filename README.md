# Java-Assignment
Group work task to create a library loan application.
Application was to be created to allow loans of books and DVDs while recording and validating this information into LOAN.csv.
My contribution to this project was the implementation of the most of the methods that allow for loan creation of manipulation as well as the implementation of inheritance. I also worked hard to implement overiding and overloading methods.
I was also involved with handling the task of validating the data before reading it back into the .csv file.
